# This coding challenge requires you to update the below psuedo code.
# This means the below code has only been partially set up for you, and 
# WILL NOT WORK! You will need to make changes to the code to fix it.
#  
# Read the requirements and pseudo comments. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!
#

# Requirements:
#	- Create an ATM program
#	- Get user name

################

# get a name from user
# REMEMBER: the input function 
# always returns a string
rename_me = input()

# get a withdrawal amount from 
# user - this should be a number 
# REMEMBER: the input function 
# always returns a string
rename_me = input()

# convert the withdrawal amount to an integer
rename_me = int()

# create an integer variable 
# called account_total and
# assign it a value of 1000
rename_me = 0

# subtract withdraw amount 
# from account total
rename_me = rename_me - rename_me

# print the user name
print(rename_me)

# print the withdrawal amount
print(rename_me)

# print the remaining account total
print(rename_me)
