# get a name from user
# REMEMBER: the input function 
# always returns a string
rename_me = input()

# get a withdraw amount from 
# user - this should be a number 
# REMEMBER: the input function 
# always returns a string
rename_me = input()

# convert the withdraw amount to integer
rename_me = int()

# create an integer variable 
# called account_total and
# assign it a value of 1000
rename_me = 0

# subtract withdraw amount 
# from account total
rename_me = rename_me - rename_me

# print the user name
print(rename_me)

# print the withdraw amount
print(rename_me)

# print the remaining account total
print(rename_me)
