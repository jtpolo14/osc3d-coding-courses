Terminology
* Data Type - a particular kind of data item, as defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it
* Integer - a whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero. Therefore, the numbers 10, 0, -25, and 5,148 are all integers. Unlike floating point numbers, integers cannot have decimal places. Integers are a commonly used data type in computer programming
* String - a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable
* Casting - setting the data type of a variable

Requirement(s)

* Open IDLE or python console and convert '12345' to an integer 

Step(s)

* Assign `12345` to `my_string` 
* find the type of `my_string` using the `type()` function
* Assign `my_integer` to be `int(my_mystring)`
* Use type again to find the data type of `my_integer`
