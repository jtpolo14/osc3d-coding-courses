# Lecture 06 - Flow Control

--------------------
Description
-------------------- 
You will learn how to:
* Write conditional tests using 'if'
* Write conditional tests using 'else'
* Write conditional tests using 'elif'
* Use indenting to create code blocks
* Use relational operators (equals, greater than, less than)
* Use logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)

Terminology
* Conditional Test - Rules that instruct programs how to determine whether certain conditions are being met and then what to do next.
* If statement - evaluates whether a statement is true or false, and run code only in the case that the statement is true.
* Indenting - spaces used to align code blocks
* Code Block - sections of code that work perform a specific task 
* Relational Operators - operators that compare the values on either side of them and decide the relation among them
	* Equal to (==) - If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.
	* Greater than (>) - If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
	* Less than (<) - If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. 
* Logical Operators - used for combining and reversing tests
	* AND - If both the operands are true then condition becomes true.
	* OR - If any of the two operands are non-zero then condition becomes true.
	* NOT - Used to reverse the logical state of its operand.

Lab
-------------------- 

Requirement(s)
* Create a program that gets a test score from the user and outputs the numerical and letter grade.

Step(s)
 
* Create a python file named grader.py
* Copy and paste the code provided from lecture06/grader.py
* Run the program by, typing the following command and press Enter:
```
python3 grader.py
```
* When prompted 'What is the test score?', type any number and press Enter:
```
What is the test score? 99
99 A
```

Help
-------------------- 

If you run into issues with the above lab, here are some helpful tips to try:
* Make sure the python version is 3.4 or above, lower versions and python 2 may not work
* Make sure the python file is saved with the '.py' file extension
* Be sure to type the terminal command exactly as shown, then press Enter
